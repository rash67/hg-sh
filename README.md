# hg-sh
inspired by https://github.com/rtomayko/git-sh when i was forced to work in hg (not so bad, but mono-repos are)

mostly it's be fumbling bash and tab-completion and learning to add revest completion to other non-hg commands (that are scripts). probably better ways to do this.

offerered-as is. maybe someone can make it more useful
